# RSA-Factoring-Challenge
Trying to crack an RSA key by factoring it

# TASK 1
This task involves creating a program that reads numbers from another file e.g a test file and for each line on the test file contains a natural number greater than 1. So our program should factorize each number into a product of two small numbers. e.g given 12 our program should output 12=6*2
